It is with great sadness that we share the news that our colleague, Shixin Chen, passed away on August 24th, 2025.

Chen had been bravely fighting cancer for over a year while continuing to dedicate himself to his work. His courage, professionalism, and positive spirit inspired all of us, even during the most difficult times.

We are deeply grateful for his many contributions to Treasure Data over the 7 years he was with us. Chen was well known as being both technically excellent and compassionate. He will be remembered not only for his talent and dedication, but also for his kindness and the warmth he brought to those around him.

Among his many achievements, Chen played a key role in the design of PBP, the foundation of our service's access control. He was the first engineer to fully document the overall design, ensuring that this critical component was clearly understood and well-structured. This contribution has had a lasting impact on our platform and our engineering culture.

Over these past months, many of our engineers—as well as several alumni—quietly supported Chen during his illness. I am deeply thankful for their care and solidarity, which reflect the strength of our community and the bonds that connect us beyond work.

Our thoughts are with his family during this difficult time. We ask everyone to join us in honoring his memory and supporting one another as we grieve this loss.
